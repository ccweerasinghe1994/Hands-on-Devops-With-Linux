## 1. Getting Started With Linux
This chapter will introduce you to the `Linux` world with a focus on `servers`. Therefore, I will not explain about it on `desktops`. You will see explanations about Linux, why you `should` know `it`, its basic concepts, and a lot of `commands`. I am a technical guy, so brace yourself because you are about to see how to set up your `lab` hands-on!
### 1.1 Structure
- In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
- What is Linux
  - Distributions 
  - Servers
- Setting up your environment
  - Installing the VirtualBox
  - Installing a Linux system
- Accessing via SSH
- Introduction to Bash
  - Useful commands
  - Basic files and how to edit them
  - Customizing your shell
  - Installing packages
### 1.2 Objectives
After studying this unit, you should be able to:   
- Understand the basics of Linux
- Choose your favorite distribution
- Install your virtual machine
- Access any remote Linux server
### 1.3 What is Linux?
In my view, if you bought this book, you probably have a basic idea of what is
`Linux` and you already know why you want to learn it. Thus summarizing, Linux
is an operating system with an `open-source code`, and works similar to the
famous `Windows`, but it does not belong to any company. So, how is the code
open? Everyone can download the `core Linux` using this site:
https://www.kernel.org/, and if you are interested to give a look around the
`source code`, it can be found on this link https://git.kernel.org/.

Linux has this name because of its creator, `Linus Torvalds`. The first 3 letters are
the initials of Linus, and the last 2 come from another OS, called Minix, created
by a man, named Andrew Tanenbaum.

It is common for you to see Linux bound to other initials, like `GNU`. This
happens because when Linus Torvalds was creating Linux, he used many tools
that were created by the `GNU project`, https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html. The
GNU project began with Richard Stallman, the creator of the `Free Software
Foundation`, https://www.fsf.org. What does it mean to license an `open-source`?
It means that every software written by the GNU project has its code open for
everyone who wants to work on it. Then, how Linus Torvalds used the tools
from the GNU project? He decided to use the same philosophy of the open source and he released the Linux system with the tools from the GNU project.
This explains the term `GNU/Linux`.
